# Auto Insurance Claim Prediction  ‚ú® üöóüìà  ‚ú®

This project demonstrates my ability to work with large, messy datasets in the insurance domain, focusing on two key predictive goals:
1. **The probability of a car crash** (`TARGET_FLAG`) - Binary Logistic Regression
2. **The potential claim amount if a crash occurs** (`TARGET_AMT`) - Multiple Linear Regression

## Why This Matters
Insurance providers rely on accurate predictions for:
1. Assessing risk effectively
2. Setting fair premiums
3. Streamlining claim processes


## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow

The project workflow is a robust, step-by-step process designed to manage high-dimensional, messy data:Below is the comprehensive flowchart of the workflow:

## üöÄ Models Built and Evaluated

### 1. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
   - **Full Model**: Includes all predictors to assess the overall feature impact.
   - **Stepwise Model**: Refined using stepwise selection to improve simplicity and interpretability.

### 2. Binary Logistic Regression (BLR)
   - **Null Model**: Serves as a baseline.
   - **Full Model**: Includes all predictors to explore all possible risk factors.
   - **Stepwise Model**: Adds preprocessing steps (removing near-zero variance and correlated features) for a leaner, more focused model.

## üîç Key Contributions
### Domain Expertise:
Applied domain knowledge to select relevant predictors and interpret results for insurance-specific use cases.

### Dirty Dataset Handling:
Dealt with messy, inconsistent datasets by creating a systematic data preparation workflow.



## üìä Key Results and Visualizations

### Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression (MLR):

The Stepwise MLR model slightly outperformed the Full Model with a higher Adjusted R-squared and F-statistic, balanced predictive power with model simplicity.

### Binary Logistic Regression (BLR) Metrics

The Stepwise BLR model achieved the best AUC, Kappa, and F1 scores, demonstrating balanced predictive power with reduced predictor redundancy.
